## üèóÔ∏è Data Processing & Key SQL Queries  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Total Orders and Weight by Plant**  
‚úÖ **Identifies plants with the highest order volume** and **total shipping weight**.  

```sql
SELECT 
    o.Plant_Code,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Orders,
    SUM(o.Unit_quantity) AS Total_Units,
    SUM(o.Weight) AS Total_Weight
FROM OrderList o
GROUP BY o.Plant_Code
ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC;
```

üîπ **Findings:**  
- **Plant 03 has the highest order volume**, indicating a **high demand center**.  
- **Weight distribution across plants** helps in **balancing logistics load efficiently**.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Top 5 Most Ordered Products**  
‚úÖ **Determines the highest demand products by units and order count.**  

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 Product_ID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM OrderList
GROUP BY Product_ID
ORDER BY OrderCount DESC;
```

üîπ **Findings:**  
- **Product ID 1684862 is the most ordered item**, showing high demand.  
- **Insights help in inventory planning** and **warehouse stocking strategies**.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Warehouse Utilization Analysis**  
‚úÖ **Checks if warehouses are exceeding their daily capacity limits.**  

```sql
SELECT
  o.Plant_Code,
  CAST(o.Order_Date AS DATE) AS OrderDay,
  SUM(o.Unit_quantity) AS TotalUnits,
  wc.Daily_Capacity,
  CASE 
    WHEN SUM(o.Unit_quantity) > wc.Daily_Capacity THEN 'Over Capacity' 
    ELSE 'Under Capacity' 
  END AS CapacityStatus
FROM OrderList o
JOIN WarehouseCapacity wc
  ON o.Plant_Code = wc.Plant_ID
GROUP BY o.Plant_Code, CAST(o.Order_Date AS DATE), wc.Daily_Capacity;
```

üîπ **Findings:**  
- **Some warehouses exceed daily capacity**, leading to **logistics bottlenecks**.  
- **Optimizing distribution** can **reduce warehouse overload issues**.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **On-Time Shipping Performance by Carrier**  
‚úÖ **Evaluates carrier reliability by calculating on-time shipping percentages.**  

```sql
SELECT Carrier,
	CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Ship_Late_Day_count = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.00
    / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL (10, 2)) AS OnTimeRate
FROM OrderList
GROUP BY Carrier
ORDER BY OnTimeRate DESC;
```

üîπ **Findings:**  
- **Carrier V44_3 has the highest on-time shipping rate**, making it the most **reliable logistics partner**.  
- **Carrier V444_0 struggles with delays**, requiring **further investigation into operational inefficiencies**.  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Orders Exceeding Weight Limits**  
‚úÖ **Identifies shipments that exceed freight weight restrictions.**  

```sql
WITH shipping_table AS(
	SELECT o.Order_ID, o.Origin_Port, o.Destination_Port, o.Weight, f.max_wgh_qty,
		   CASE 
			   WHEN o.Weight > f.max_wgh_qty THEN 'EXCEEDED'
			   ELSE 'WITHIN LIMIT'
		   END AS Shipping_Status
	FROM OrderList o
	JOIN FreightRates f ON o.Origin_Port = f.orig_port_cd 
						AND o.Destination_Port = f.dest_port_cd
)
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM shipping_table
WHERE Shipping_Status = 'EXCEEDED'
ORDER BY [Weight] DESC;
```

üîπ **Findings:**  
- **Several orders exceed shipping limits**, leading to **additional costs or shipment delays**.  
- **Optimizing weight distribution** across orders can **reduce cost overruns**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Logistics Cost Calculation**  
‚úÖ **Determines total logistics cost per order, including freight and warehouse storage costs.**  

```sql
SELECT
    o.Order_ID,
    -- Freight Cost
    CASE 
        WHEN o.Weight < f.minm_wgh_qty THEN f.minimum_cost
        ELSE ROUND(o.Weight * f.rate, 2)
    END AS Freight_Cost,

    -- Warehouse Cost
    ROUND(o.Unit_quantity * wc.Cost_unit, 2) AS Warehouse_Cost,

    -- Summation
    CASE 
        WHEN o.Weight < f.minm_wgh_qty THEN f.minimum_cost
        ELSE ROUND(o.Weight * f.rate, 2)
    END 
    + ROUND((o.Unit_quantity * wc.Cost_unit), 2) AS Total_Logistics_Cost
FROM OrderList AS o
INNER JOIN FreightRates AS f
    ON  o.Carrier = f.Carrier
    AND o.Origin_Port = f.orig_port_cd
    AND o.Destination_Port = f.dest_port_cd
    AND o.Weight BETWEEN f.minm_wgh_qty AND f.max_wgh_qty
INNER JOIN WarehouseCosts AS wc
    ON O.Plant_Code = wc.WH;
```

üîπ **Findings:**  
- **Freight costs contribute significantly** to total logistics expenses.  
- **Optimizing warehouse selection and carrier choice** can **reduce total supply chain costs**.
